  abstract       = {Java_light is a large sequential sublanguage of Java.
                   We formalize its abstract syntax, type system,
                   well-formedness conditions, and an operational
                   evaluation semantics. Based on this formalization, we
                   can express and prove type soundness. All definitions
                   and proofs have been done formally in the theorem
                   prover Isabelle/HOL. Thus this paper demonstrates that
                   machine-checking the design of non-trivial programming
                   languages has become a reality.},

	          of formalisms related to mobile agents. It describes
	          the $\pi$-calculus and its extensions, the Ambient
	          calculus, Petri nets, Actors, and the family of
	          generative communication languages. Each of these
	          formalisms defines a mathematical framework that can
	          be used to reason about mobile code; they vary
	          greatly in their expressiveness, in the mechanisms
	          they provide to specify mobile code based
	          applications and in their practical usefulness for
	          the validation and the verification of such
	          applications.   
                  In this paper we show how these formalisms can be 
		  used to represent the mobility and communication 
		  aspects of two mobile code environments: Obliq and 
		  Messengers. We compare and classify the different 
		  formalisms with respect to mobility and discuss some
                  shortcomings and desirable extensions. We also point
		  to other emerging concepts in formalisms for 
		  mobile code systems.",
