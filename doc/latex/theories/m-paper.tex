% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V1.3 OCTOBER 2002
% This file should be compiled with V1.6 of "sig-alternate.cls" OCTOBER 2002
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V1.6 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V1.6) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 2002) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2003} will cause 2002 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The task of designing and implementing a compiler can be a
difficult and error-prone process.  In this paper, we present a new
approach based on the use of higher-order abstract syntax and term
rewriting in a logical framework.  All program transformations, from
parsing to code generation, are cleanly isolated and specified as term
rewrites.  This has several advantages.  The correctness of the
compiler depends solely on a small set of rewrite rules that are
written in the language of formal mathematics.  In addition, the logical
framework guarantees the preservation of scoping, and it automates
many frequently-occurring tasks including substitution and rewriting
strategies.  As we show, compiler development in a logical framework
can be \emph{easier} than in a general-purpose language like ML, in
part because of automation, and also because the framework provides
extensive support for examination, validation, and debugging of the
compiler transformations.  The paper is organized around a case study,
using the \MetaPRL{} logical framework to compile an ML-like language to
Intel x86 assembly.  We also present a scoped formalization of x86
assembly in which all registers are immutable.
