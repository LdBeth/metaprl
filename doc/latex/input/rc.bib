	Such a certified compiler is useful in the context of formal methods

	system, well-formedness conditions, and an operational evaluation
	semantics. Based on these definitions, we can express soundness of
	the type system, an important design goal claimed to be reached by
	the designers of Java, and prove that Bali is indeed type-safe. All
	definitions and proofs have been done formally in the theorem prover
	Isabelle/HOL. Thus this article demonstrates that machine-checking
	the design of non-trivial programming languages has become a reality.},
