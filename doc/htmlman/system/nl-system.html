is implemented as an extended OCaml compiler. Modules in Nuprl-Light
can be plain prgrams, or they can be extended to additional logical
definitions and syntax. The architecture of the system is summarized
in the diagram at the right. The complete system contains these
parts:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The <B><A HREF="nl-refiner.html">refiner</A></B> implements
  logical operations and accounting. The refiner associates an
  accounting object called a <I>sentinal</I> with each module.
  The sentinal defines the valid set of logical inferences, syntax
  definitions, computational equaivalences, and programs in a module.
  The sentinal is passed between refiners during distributed computation
  to localize the context of a refinement.
  <LI>The <B><A HREF="nl-filter.html">module compiler</A></B> is
  used to compile Nuprl-Light modules into two parts: an ML module
  that defines the computation in the module, and a sentinal that
  expresses the logical content. The module compiler is right above
  the refiner; it has no knowledge of proofs, whether they be automated
  or interactive. The compiler simply compiles logical content,
  to be used later by the <B>module editor.</B>
  <LI>The refiner defines an abstract logical interface. The <B><A
  HREF="nl-ensemble.html">distributed prover</A></B> implements
  the same interface, but the logical operations are spread across
  multiple machines. The distributed prover contains a scheduler
  to hand out logical goals, and a failure recovery algorithm to
  handle refiner failures.
  <LI>The <B><A HREF="nl-chaining.html">forward chainer</A></B>
  implements proof caching and forward chaining. Currently, forward
  chaining is restricted to forward rules with a finite forward
  closure. Once again, the forward chainer reimplements the refiner
  interface.
  <LI>The <B><A HREF="nl-tacticals.html">tactic definitions</A></B>
  implement the tactic combinator language over the refiner. Logical
  proofs use basic combinators: each logical definition in a module
  defines a tactic, and the tactic module provide tactic combinators
  that are used for automation.
  <LI>The <B><A HREF="nl-ocaml.html">OCaml syntax</A></B> is defined
  as a logical module containing syntax definitions and an operational
  semantics for the OCaml definitions in a module. The <B>module
  compiler</B> compiles ML programs to logical terms; the OCaml
  syntax module defines the logical properties and semantics of
  the programs.
  <LI>The <B><A HREF="nl-base.html">logic definition</A></B> module
  defines properties shared by many logics. For example, the Nuprl-Light
  framework has no knowledge of sequents, but many logics use sequents
  to express their inference rules. The basic logic module defines
  sequents. In addition, the basic logic module defines tactics
  for automation, including automation of introduction and elimination
  rules, equality reasoning, and general tactic-based search.
  <LI>The logics currently defined include the Nuprl type theory,
  Aczel's set theory, first order logic, and a partial implementation
  of the Edinburgh logical framework (LF).
  <LI>The <B><A HREF="nl-editor-imp.html">module editor</A></B>
  provides interactive support, including a module navigator, a
  proof editor, and context-sensitive toploop language.
