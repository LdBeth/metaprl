<H1>MetaPRL Compiler</H1>

<P>MetaPRL is implemented as an extension of the OCaml compiler.
The syntax of OCaml is extended by using CamlP4 to add a syntax
for terms and a syntax for logical objects in modules. MetaPRL
files have the same <TT>.ml</TT> and <TT>.mli</TT> suffixes as
normal OCaml files. The MetaPRL compiler is called <TT>prlc</TT>.
The usage is as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>% prlc [OCaml options] file.ml
% prlc [OCaml options] file.mli</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The MetaPRL compiler produces additional files that summarize
the <I>logical</I> content of the files that were compiled. For
each interface <TT>file.mli</TT>, an file <TT>file.cmiz</TT> file
is created that summarizes the logical content of the interface.
The <TT>file.cmi</TT> file is still created, containing ML definitions
used by the compiler for interface checking.</P>

<P>For each implementation file <TT>file.ml</TT>, a file <TT>file.cmoz</TT>
is created that summarizes the logical content of the module (the
<TT>file.cmo</TT> file is still created for the ML content). The
logical files with the <TT>.cmiz</TT> and <TT>.cmoz</TT> suffixes
are used during compilation for determining compile-time logical
consistency. They are also used by the <A HREF="http://x/">proof
editor</A> to navigate the logical theories. They represent a
<I>complete</I> summary of the source: they can be compiled directly
with the <TT>prlc</TT> compiler.</P>

<PRE>    % prlc [OCaml options] file.cmiz
    % prlc [OCaml options] file.cmoz</PRE>

<H2>Implementation</H2>

<P>The compiler is implemented in the <TT>filter</TT> directory.
There are five main parts to the &quot;filter.&quot;</P>

<OL>
  <LI>The <TT>filter_parse</TT> module defines the extended logical
  syntax.
  <LI>The <TT>filter_summary</TT> module defines the components
  of compiled files that are saved in the <TT>.cmiz</TT> and <TT>.cmoz</TT>
  files.
  <LI>The <TT>filter_cache</TT> module defines the logical data
  structures used to maintain the logical consistency of compiled
  modules.
  <LI>The <TT>filter_prog</TT> module defines the output routines
  that translate <I>logical</I> objects to their ML representations.
  <LI>The <TT>filter_ocaml</TT> module defines the translation
  between ML programs and logical <I>terms.</I>
