<H2>MetaPRL Term Rewriting</H2>

<P>The MetaPRL term rewriter is easily the most complex piece
of the refiner. Rewrites are defined using <I>second-order substitution.</I>
The variable syntax is extended to include variables that specify
terms with bound variables, or substitutions. The notation for
a second order variable is a variable followed by a list of subterms
in brackets: like the following <TT>v[t1; t2]</TT>. A rewrite
is specified in two parts: a <I>redex</I> pattern, and a <I>contractum</I>
pattern, and occurrences of second order variables are treated
differently by the rewriter. Consider the following example:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><B>rewrite</B> beta : apply{lambda{x. 'b['x]}; 'a} &lt;--&gt; 'b['a]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This rewrite definition is used to define <I>beta-reduction</I>
in the lambda-calculus. The redex pattern is the application <TT>apply{lambda{x.
'b['x]}; 'a}</TT>. There are two second-order variables in the
pattern: the variables <TT>'b['x]</TT> and <TT>'a</TT>. The variable
<TT>'b['x]</TT> represent a term, with a possible occurrence of
a free variable <TT>'x</TT>. The variable <TT>'a</TT> also represents
a term, but without any special occurrences of free variables.</P>

<P>The <I>contractum</I> definition includes the same variables,
but the free variable has been replaced by the term represented
by <TT>'a</TT>. In any rewrite definition, the second order variables
in the redex specify <I>matching</I>, and the second-order variables
in the contractum specify <I>substitution</I>. In fact, the rewrite
definition for <TT>beta</TT> can be translated to an equivalent
substitution form. Let <TT>'b['x &lt;- 'a]</TT> represent substitution
of the term <TT>'a</TT> for the variable <TT>'x</TT> in the term
<TT>'b</TT>. The beta rewrite is equivalent to the following definition:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><B>rewrite</B> beta : apply{lambda{x. 'b}; 'a} &lt;--&gt; 'b['x &lt;- 'a]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The application of a rewrite is to a a normal term. Redex <I>matching</I>
is defined recursively. A redex pattern is either a second-order
variable, or it is a term with redex patterns for its subterms.
A <I>term</I> pattern matches a (regular) term if the operators
are equal, the arities of the subterms are equal, and the subterm
patterns match each of the subterms of the (regular) term. A <I>second-order
variable</I> <TT>'v['x1; ...; 'xn]</TT> matches any term.</P>

<P>When a redex is matched, the values matched by each of the
second-order variables are saved, along with renaming for the
bound variables. When the contractum is constructed, substitution
is used to construct term values for each of the second-order
variables in the contractum. For example, suppose we apply the
<TT>beta</TT> rewrite to a specific term</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>apply{lambda{z. 'y + 'z}; 1}</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The redex matching produces the following results:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>'a: 'a = 1
'b['x]: ('x = 'z): 'b['x] = 'y + 'x</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This table specifies that that variable <TT>'x</TT> is renamed
to <TT>'z</TT>, and term <TT>'b['z]</TT> is the body of the lambda:
<TT>'y + 'z</TT>. The construction of the contractum substitutes
the value for <TT>'a</TT> (<TT>1</TT>), for the variable <TT>'x</TT>
(which has been renamed to <TT>'z</TT>), and the result of the
application is the term <TT>'y + 1</TT></P>

<P>The difference between the second-order form of a rewrite,
and the substitution form arises when multiple occurrences of a
second order variable occur in a redex pattern. These multiple
patterns specify term equivalences. For example, we might define
a rewrite that &quot;doubles&quot; its argument:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>rewrite double : ('x + 'x) &lt;--&gt; (2 * 'x)</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This rewrite uses syntactic equivalence: the following application
is valid:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>(7 + 7) --&gt; 2 * 7</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>But the following rewrite fails:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>(2 + (1 + 1)) --&gt; fails</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Rewriter Implementation</H3>

<P>The rewriter is implemented in four parts:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>A redex pattern compiler.
  <LI>A contractum pattern compiler (constructed against a compiled
  redex).
  <LI>A redex matcher.
  <LI>A contractum builder (constructed from a previously matched
  redex).
</OL>

<P>These four parts are implemented as separate modules sharing
common type definitions, and the result rewriter module <TT>Rewrite</TT>
is constructed by composing the four modules.
