<H1>MetaPRL OCaml Support</H1>

<P>MetaPRL provides built-in support for OCaml with two theory
directories: <TT>theories/ocaml</TT> and <TT>theories/ocaml_sos</TT>.
The first directory contains display definitions for OCaml, and
the second contains an operational semantics for OCaml.</P>

<P>This document is not yet complete. There are three main issues
to discuss:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>What is the logical representation of OCaml programs?
  <LI>What is the operational semantics?
  <LI>What is the interpretation in Nuprl type theory?
</OL>
