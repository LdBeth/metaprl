<H1>Nuprl-Light Proof Caching and Chaining</H1>

<P>You can read a paper on <I>Forward Chaining in Higher Order
Logics</I> for a more complete exposition of chaining.</P>

<P>The <I>chainer</I> is implemented as a layer between the refiner
and the tactic definitions; it provides caching of the proofs
generated by the tactic. The goal of the chainer is two-fold:
maintain a cache of already-proved goals, so that tactics do not
have to repeat proofs; and provide a mechanism for chaining to
derive proofs that may be needed during interaction.</P>

<P>The chainer is implemented only for sequent calculi. Some examples
of typical forward chaining rules defined in the <TT>ITT</TT>
logic:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>'A &amp; 'B --&gt; 'A
'A &amp; 'B --&gt; 'B
('A -&gt; 'B) in Ui --&gt; ('A in Ui)</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The chainer works in the background, whenever the interactive
prover is waiting for input. If a proof is <I>found</I> by chaining,
the user is notified that a proof is available. Otherwise the
chainer does not affect the process of proving.</P>

<P>The chainer is implemented with an extended version of sequents,
containing the actual hypotheses presented to the user, and additional
hypotheses derived by forward chaining.
