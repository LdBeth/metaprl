<H1>MetaPRL Tutorial</H1>

<P><I><B>Warning:</B> This tutorial is very outdated.</I> Many things would not probably
work exactly as described. Additionally, we have implemented several mechanisms (such as resource
annotations) that are much easier to use than the mechanisms used in this tutorial.</P>

<P>In this tutorial we develop an account of classical first-order
logic, and we relate it to the Nuprl type theory <TT>Itt_theory</TT>.
The theory we develop is fully modular. It contains modules for
each of the logical operators, and the constructive logic is a
subtheory of the classical logic. We also investigate proof automation.
Each module defines proof procedures for its operator, and the
final logic defines an automated proof procedure for the logic.</P>

<P>The first step in creating a logic is creating a module for
each of the logical operators. Initially, the framework has no
notion of truth or falsehood in the logic; these concepts are
defined by declaring syntax and logical rules. Our logic will
include the logical operators in first-order logic (FOL), and
it will include terms to represent <I>true</I> and <I>false</I>.
We will use a single-conclusion sequent calculus (a multi-conclusion
sequent calculus is also possible, but this choice will make it
easier to relate the logic to the type theory).</P>
