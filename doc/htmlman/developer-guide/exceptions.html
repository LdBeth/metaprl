<H2>Conventions on Using Exceptions in MetaPRL</H2>
<P>When it comes to raising and catching exceptions,
MetaPRL expects its modules to observe certain rules. This section describes the rules
you'll need to follow to make sure your code does not change the system behavior
in any unwanted way.

<H3><TT>Invalid_argument</TT> and other "serious" exceptions</H3>
<P><B>Raising.</B> In MetaPRL, <TT>Invalid_argument</TT> exceptions is a canonical way
to notify user about potential bugs in the system.
And more generally, when something happens that prohibits your code from returning a sensible answer
and you believe that user has to be notified, raise <TT>Invalid_argument</TT>.
To be more precise, you should raise an <TT>Invalid_argument</TT>
in following cases:<OL>
<LI><I>A bug in a function you've called.</I> A function that you called returned something it
was not supposed to return
<LI><I>A bug in your code.</I>You found out that your data structure is in some inconsistent state that it was not supposed to enter, or,
in general, your code did something that it was not supposed to do.
<LI><I>A bug in a code that called your code.</I> Your interface function was called with some
arguments it was not supposed to be called with. In particular, if you haven't yet implemented
some functionality you should raise and <TT>Invalid_argument</TT> exception
to notify the user when some code attempts to use that functionality.<P>However if it makes
sense to call your functions with some class of inputs even if the function will not
necessarily be successful on these inputs (for example, it may make sense to call the <TT>unify</TT> function even if you are not sure whether the terms are unifiable), then it may be
reasonable to not consider such calls to be a bug and raise <TT>RefineError</TT> exception
instead of <TT>Invalid_argument</TT>.
</OL>
<P><B>Catching.</B>
We need to make sure that whenever an <TT>Invalid_argument</TT> is raised, it will
go all the way up to the user.
Because of that, you are not supposed to catch <TT>Invalid_argument</TT> exceptions. In particular, it means that you are not supposed to use "catch all" <TT> try ... with _ -&gt; ...</TT>
expression.<P>The same is true for other "serious" exceptions from the <TT>Pervasives</TT> module. In particular, your code should not catch any of
<TT>Match_failure</TT>, <TT>Assert_failure</TT>, <TT>Out_of_memory</TT>, <TT>Stack_overflow</TT> and <TT>Division_by_zero</TT> exceptions without a good reason.
<H3><TT>RefineError</TT> exceptions.</H3>
<TT>RefineError</TT> exceptions are used to notify the caller that a certain proof search
step is not applicable to the current goal and/or failed. More generally, it is used to
notify the caller function that whatever it tried to do was unsuccessful and it should
try something else or give up.

<P><B>Examples</B>: <TT>dest_var_term</TT> would raise <TT>RefineError</TT> if its input term
is not a variable. <TT>unify</TT> would raise <TT>RefineError</TT> if input terms are not
unifiable. A primitive tactic would raise <TT>RefineError</TT> if a rule is not applicable
to the current goal.

<P>The <TT>orelseT</TT> and similar tacticals only "know" about <TT>RefineError</TT>
exceptions. <TT>(t1 orelseT t2)</TT> would run <TT>t2</TT> if and only if <TT>t1</TT>
raises <TT>RefineError</TT> exception.
<P><B>Raising.</B> When a certain proof search or proof refinement procedure can not be applied
to the given input, raise <TT>RefineError</TT>. On the other hand, if you believe that
the procedure shouldn't have even been attempted on such an input,
raise <TT>Invalid_argument</TT> to notify the user of a problem. Note that if you are doing
a lot of raising and catching of <TT>RefineError</TT>s, you may want to consider raising <TT>generic_refiner_exn</TT> to avoid unnecessary allocation overhead.
<P><B>Catching.</B>
Whenever you are calling something that may raise <TT>RefineError</TT>, feel free to catch it.
Of course, if you procedure has no way of recovering from that error, it would make
sense to just let this exception to propagate back up. But there is one restriction - if
you catch some <TT>RefineError</TT>s, you have to catch them all, not matter what the parameters
are. And your code's behavior should not in any way depend on the parameters of the
<TT>RefineError</TT> exception it caught. In short, you have to always use
<TT> try ... with RefineError _ -&gt; ...</TT> for catching <TT>RefineError</TT> exceptions.
This limitation makes it possible to increase efficiency by replacing some common
<TT>RefineError</TT> exceptions with with <TT>generic_refiner_exn</TT>.
<H3>Other exceptions</H3>
You are welcome to use any exceptions you want in your code - both preexisting ones and
the new ones you've defined. However, you should make sure that none of those exceptions
can escape through the interface functions. And interface functions should not raise any
exceptions other than <TT>RefineError</TT> and <TT>Invalid_argument</TT>.
<H3>Exception Exceptions</H3>
There are a few exceptions from the rules outlined above. One of them is the user I/O code.
The user I/O code is supposed to catch all the exceptions (including <TT>Invalid_argument</TT>)
and print all the information about the caught exception (including the parameters of the
<TT>RefineError exception</TT>). After the exception is printed, the system should abort
the task that rose the exception and wait for further instructions from the user.

<P> Another exception is the low-level code that implements some basic operations or basic
data structures and is located below the Refiner in the module hierarchy (for example - all
the code in the <TT>mllib/</TT> directory). For such code, it's normal to raise one of the
standard exceptions, such as <TT>Failure</TT> or <TT>Not_found</TT>.
<P><B>P.S.</B> If your interface function may raise some exception, it may be a good
idea to document that in the <TT>.mli</TT> file and tell in which situations what
exceptions would be raised. Of course, you do not have to document obvious things like
"<I>this function will raise <TT>Invalid_argument</TT> if there is a bug or when called with
invalid argument</I>" or "<I>This tactic will raise <TT>RefineError</TT> if proof search fails</I>".
