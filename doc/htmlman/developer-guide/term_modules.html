<H2>MetaPRL Term Modules and Types</H2>

<P>MetaPRL terms have an interface (type <TT>term'</TT>) and an abstract (type <TT>term</TT>)   
representations. The <TT>term'</TT> type is defined in
<A HREF="../../../refiner/refsig/term_simple_sig.mlz"><TT>refiner/refsig/term_simple_sig.mlz</TT></A>
and is fixed while the <TT>term</TT> type may be
different in different modules.

<P>The <TT>Term_std</TT> module (actually, it is
not a single module, but a collection of several modules, files in
<TT>refiner/term_std/</TT>) can be considered a reference implementation.
In <TT>Term_std</TT>, <TT>term</TT> is just equal to <TT>term'</TT>.

<P>In the <TT>Term_ds</TT> module   
("ds" stands for delayed substitutions", files in <TT>refiner/term_ds/</TT>) <TT>term</TT>
type is different from <TT>term'</TT> - <TT>term</TT> has a field for set of free variables
(which is computed lazily) and a field <TT>core</TT> that carries either <TT>term'</TT> or
a delayed substitution or a sequent or a variable (in <TT>Term_std</TT> variables
and sequents are encoded with <TT>term'</TT>s, but it turned out to be more
efficient to handle them specially).

<P>There are also some parts of the term
module that do not have to know what the <TT>term</TT> is as they work through the
<TT>term'</TT> interface type - these files are located in <TT>refiner/term_gen</TT>. For
most (if not all) of these files it was possible to write a more efficient implementation
for <TT>Term_ds</TT>, so <TT>Term_ds</TT> may have its own version of these files.

<P>The
parts of the term module are collected together and packed with refiner
and rewriter in <TT>refiner/refiner/refiner_*.ml</TT> files. Few parts of the system
specify which of the term modules they want. The <TT>REFINER</TT> variable
in the <TT>mk/config</TT> file decides which term module would be used in the rest of the system.
