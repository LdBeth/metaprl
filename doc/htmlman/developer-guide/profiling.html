<H2>Introduction to MetaPRL Profiling</H2>

<P>There are two ways to get the profiling information for MetaPRL - native code
profiling and bytecode profiling. Native code profiling would give the amount
of time spent in and inside a function, number of calls for each function
and for each pair of functions - <TT>f<SUB>1</SUB></TT> and <TT>f<SUB>2</SUB></TT>
- how many times <TT>f<SUB>1</SUB></TT> called <TT>f<SUB>2</SUB></TT> and how much
time was spent in <TT>f<SUB>2</SUB></TT> when it was called from <TT>f<SUB>1</SUB></TT>. The
bytecode profiling would give the number of calls for each function and for each
branching operator (such as <TT>if</TT>, <TT>match</TT>, <TT>try ... with</TT>)
it would give information
on how many times each branch was taken. Currently bytecode profiling information would
be available only for files that are not pre-processed (although we hope to fix it someday)
while in native code everything (including the
standard OCaml libraries and even the garbage collection) would be profiled.
The bytecode profiling should work on any system capable of compiling and
running MetaPRL. The native code profiling should work on any Linux system that
uses glibc 2 library. It may also work on other Linux systems and Digital Unix
systems.

<H3>Native Code Profiling</H3>

<P>In order to profile some code, you have to be able to call that code from
the MetaPRL top loop. In order to do that you have to either declare
you functions as <TT>topval</TT> in one of the <TT>prlc</TT>-compiled modules or to add it
to the <TT>commands</TT> variable in the <TT>editor/ml/shell.ml</TT>

<P>After you've made all the necessary modifications to the code, run 
<PRE>make clean; make profile</PRE>
However, if the source tree was already compiled with "<TT>make profile</TT>", you can
recompile it just by running "<TT>make profile</TT>" without "<TT>make clean</TT>".

After the code was compiled:<OL>
<LI>Start native-code version of MetaPRL: "<TT>cd editor/ml; ./mpopt</TT>"
<LI>Do all necessary preparation steps
<LI>Reset the profiling counters, so that the MetaPRL startup code and your
  preparation code does not get included into the profiling information:
  "<TT>restart_gmon ();;</TT>"
<LI>Run the code you want to profile
<LI>Dump the profiling information: "<TT>stop_gmon ();;</TT>". This should create a
  <TT>gmon.out</TT> file in the <TT>editor/ml</TT> directory
<LI>Do the cleanup, if necessary
<LI>Exit MetaPRL
</OL>

<P>Now you can produce the actual profiling information by running "<TT>gprof mp.opt</TT>".
<B>Warning:</B> this can produce lots of output (several megabytes) and you
may want to redirect the output.

<P>The output of <TT>gprof</TT> would contain two parts - "flat profile" and "call graph".
It would also include some comments that would help you understand its contents.

<H3>Bytecode Profiling</H3>

<P>This is currently broken since <TT>ocamlprof</TT> does not know how to deal with preprocessed
files. However, this may give you some idea of what is going on in case you want to 
do bytecode profiling by-hands.

<OL>
<LI>Do a "<TT>make profile_byte</TT>". You do not have to run "<TT>make clean</TT>",
it will run it for you.
<LI>Start a bytecode version of MetaPRL: <TT>cd editor/ml; ./mptop</TT>
<LI>Do all necessary preparation steps
<LI>At this point you may want to try to reset all profiling counters to zero to
  avoid including startup and preparation into the profiling information. I am
  not sure how to do that, you probably need to go through the 
    <PRE>Profiling.counters: (string * (string * int array)) list ref</PRE>
  and reset all the arrays to 0.
<LI>Run the code you want to profile
<LI>Exit MetaPRL
</OL>

<P>At this point you should have <TT>ocamlprof.dump</TT> file in your <TT>editor/ml</TT> directory.
Now you can run "<TT>ocamlprof &lt;file you want to profile&gt;.ml</TT>". That would give you
the contents on the original <TT>.ml</TT> file with all the branches marked with the
number. Note - if you want to profile the preprocessed file (most of the MetaPRL files are
preprocessed),
you have to call <TT>ocamlprof</TT> on the file created by the preprocessor, not on
the original file.
