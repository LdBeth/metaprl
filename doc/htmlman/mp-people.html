<H2>History</H2>

<P>MetaPRL is part of a suite of projects under the heading
PRL. The <A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/NuPrl/nuprl.html">PRL project</A>
is managed by <A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/rc/DefaultRC.htm">Robert Constable</A>.
MetaPRL
was conceived in January 1996 to address the concerns of scalability
in formal systems. In the early part of the decade, Nuprl formalizations
were mostly limited to smaller problems that focused on basic
data structures and mathematical foundations. As the foundations
were implemented, it became possible to formalize larger problems,
like the verification of Ensemble being performed by Kreitz, Hayden,
and Hickey. As with any growing system, <I>scalability</I> became
a major concern: how do we share our results with other systems;
how do we design domain-specific logics; how do we get the computational
speed for proving properties of large systems? These questions
led to the modular design on MetaPRL, where logical theories
are treated as formal objects that include both the logical knowledge
and domain-specific heuristics needed to use that knowledge.</P>

<H2><A NAME="people">People</A></H2>
<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~jyh/">Jason Hickey</A> is the main author and architect of MetaPRL.
The system is a large part of his PhD thesis &quot;Frameworks
for sharing mathematics and programming.&quot;.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/nogin/">Alexey Nogin</A> is also a major contributor to MetaPRL. His
implementations of the core data structures in MetaPRL have
led to dramatic speedups in logical speed (over two orders of
magnitude on some problems).</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/eli/">Eli Barzilay</A> is working on implementing reflection in NuPRL and MetaPRL.</P>

<P><A HREF="mailto:lolorigo@cs.cornell.edu">Lori Lorigo</A> is working on connecting MetaPRL and NuPRL-5 systems.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/kopylov/">Alexei Kopylov</A> is working on better understanding and improving MetaPRL Type Theory.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://spain.slu.edu/people_at_slu/faculty/schmitt/schmitt.html">Stephan Schmitt</A> implemented a first order prover in MetaPRL.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://markov.math.msu.ru/~krupski/">Vladimir Krupski</A> is working on improving MetaPRL unification algorithms.</P>

<P><A HREF="mailto:yegor@lpcs.math.msu.ru">Yegor Bryuhov</A> implemented term cons-hashing using weak pointers and explicit DAG representations for terms. He is currently working on the arithmetical theories in MetaPRL Type Theory</P>

<P><A HREF="mailto:cwitty@newtonlabs.com">Carl Witty</A> have contributed an extensive
reference to MetaPRL Type Theory and lots of very helpful feedback.</P>

<P><A HREF="mailto:emre@its.caltech.edu">Brian Aydemir</A> is working on
formalizing the functional intermediate reprsentation (FIR) of the MC
compiler being developed at the California Institue of Technology by
Jason Hickey.  The goal is to be able to reason about code and code
transformations.</P>
