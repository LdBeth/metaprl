<H3>MetaPRL history and people</H3>

<P>MetaPRL is part of a suite of projects under the heading
Nuprl. The Nuprl projects are managed by Robert Constable, the
Nuprl page gives the history and scope of the Nuprl work. MetaPRL
was conceived in January 1996 to address the concerns of scalability
in formal systems. In the early part of the decade, Nuprl formalizations
were mostly limited to smaller problems that focused on basic
data structures and mathematical foundations. As the foundations
were implemented, it became possible to formalize larger problems,
like the verification of Ensemble being performed by Kreitz, Hayden,
and Hickey. As with any growing system, <I>scalability</I> became
a major concern: how do we share our results with other systems;
how do we design domain-specific logics; how do we get the computational
speed for proving properties of large systems? These questions
led to the modular design on MetaPRL, where logical theories
are treated as formal objects that include both the logical knowledge
and domain-specific heuristics needed to use that knowledge.</P>

<P>Jason Hickey is the main author and architect of MetaPRL.
The system is a large part of his PhD thesis &quot;Frameworks
for sharing mathematics and programming.&quot; (This will be placed
online sometime in the Fall '98).</P>

<P>Alexey Nogin is also a major contributor to MetaPRL. His
implementations of the core data structures in MetaPRL have
led to dramatic speedups in logical speed (over two orders of
magnitude on some problems).</P>

<P>Eli Barzilay is working on proof structures for MetaPRL.
His work is leading to proof representations that address the
problem of fragility that all tactic-based provers share.
