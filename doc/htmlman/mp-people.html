<H2>History</H2>

<P>MetaPRL is the latest in the PRL family of systems developed over the last
25 years as a part of the Cornell <A HREF="http://www.nuprl.org/">PRL
project</A>. MetaPRL was conceived in January 1996 to address the concerns of
scalability in formal systems. In the early part of the decade, NuPRL
formalizations were mostly limited to smaller problems that focused on basic
data structures and mathematical foundations. As the foundations were
implemented, it became possible to formalize larger problems, like the
verification of Ensemble being performed by Kreitz, Hayden, and Hickey. As
with any growing system, <I>scalability</I> became a major concern: how do we
share our results with other systems; how do we design domain-specific logics;
how do we get the computational speed for proving properties of large systems?
These questions led to the modular design on MetaPRL, where logical theories
are treated as formal objects that include both the logical knowledge and
domain-specific heuristics needed to use that knowledge. As more effort was
put into the system MetaPRL eventually grew into a very general modern system
whose modularity on all levels gives it flexibility to support a very wide
range of applications.</P>

<H2><A NAME="people">People</A></H2>
<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~jyh/">Jason Hickey</A> is the main
author and architect of MetaPRL. The system was a large part of his PhD thesis
&quot;The MetaPRL Logical Programming Environment&quot;.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://nogin.org/">Aleksey Nogin</A> joined the MetaPRL project in
1998. After Jason graduated from Cornell in 1999, Aleksey took over the
coordination of the project. The system was a large part of his PhD thesis
&quot;Theory and Implementation of an Efficient Tactic-Based Logical
Framework&quot;.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/rc/">Robert Constable</A> is
the head of the <a href="http://www.nuprl.org/">Cornell PRL Group.</a>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/kopylov/">Alexei Kopylov</A> is
working on better understanding and improving MetaPRL Type Theory. In
particular, he came up with and have implemented in MetaPRL a novel theory of
extensible records.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.gc.cuny.edu/~sartemov/">Sergei Artemov</A> is the
head of the CUNY branch of the MetaPRL group.

<p><A HREF="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~xiny/">Xin Yu</a> is working on
formalizing abstract algebra in MetaPRL.

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/lorigo/index.html">Lori
Lorigo</A> and <a
href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/NuPrl/html/eaton/eaton.html">Richard
Eaton</a> are working on connecting MetaPRL and NuPRL LPE systems.</P>

<P><A
HREF="http://spain.slu.edu/people_at_slu/faculty/schmitt/schmitt.html">Stephan
Schmitt</A> and <a
href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/kreitz/">Christoph Kreitz</a>
implemented a first order prover ("JProver") in MetaPRL.</p>

<P><A HREF="http://markov.math.msu.ru/~krupski/">Vladimir Krupski</A> is
the coordinator of the Moscow branch of the MetaPRL group. He is working on
improving MetaPRL unification algorithms.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.gc.cuny.edu/~yegor/">Yegor Bryuhov</A> implemented
term cons-hashing using weak pointers and explicit DAG representations for
terms.  He is currently working on the arithmetical theories in MetaPRL Type
Theory.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/eli/">Eli Barzilay</A> is working on
implementing reflection in NuPRL and MetaPRL.</P>

reference to MetaPRL Type Theory and lots of very helpful feedback.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~emre/">Brian Aydemir</A> is working on
formalizing the functional intermediate reprsentation (FIR) of the MC
compiler being developed at the California Institue of Technology by
Jason Hickey.  The goal is to be able to reason about code and code
transformations.</P>

<P><a HREF="http://www.adam-granicz.org/">Adam Granicz</a> is working on
generic parsing and formal compilation using the MetaPRL rewriring engine.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.idyll.org/~n8gray/">Nathan Gray</a> and <a
href="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~crt/">Cristian Tapus</a> are working on
implementing an extensible compiler (with special features like speculations
and migration) using MetaPRL.
