<H1>MetaPRL User Guide</H1>

<P>MetaPRL is implemented as an extension to the OCaml compiler.
This document covers that language extension. To know more about
the <I>logical</I> properties of MetaPRL, you should read
about the <A HREF="../framework/default.html">logical framework</A>,
and to know more about the <I>system implementation</I>, you should
read the <A HREF="../system/default.html">system description</A>.</P>

<P>The OCaml extension includes <I>interfaces</I> (<TT>.mli</TT>
files), and <I>implementations</I> (<TT>.ml</TT> files). In OCaml,
interfaces define module signatures: a declaration of the functions
that comprise an implementation. In MetaPRL, we extend signatures
with <I>logical declarations:</I> properties that are satisfied
by the implementation, including properties about the ML programs
in the implementation, and other <I>logical</I> properties including
axioms and inference rules. The implementations contain <I>programs</I>
that implement the ML declarations, and <I>proofs</I> that implement
the logical part. The framework relies on the judgements-as-types
principle: logical statements in an interface are <I>types</I>,
and their proofs in the implementation are <I>programs</I>.</P>

<P>Unlike OCaml, the logical structure of a module is defined
recursively by <I>inheritence</I>. The differences between the
logical structure and the program structure are explained in the
section on the <TT>include</TT> directive.</P>

<P>The following sections describe each of the parts of the logical
extension:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="mp-terms.html"><I>Terms</I></A> define general logical
  <I>syntax</I>.
  <LI><A HREF="mp-dform.html">Display forms</A> describe how to
  pretty-print terms.
  <LI><A HREF="mp-axiom.html">The <TT>axiom</TT> directive</A>
  defines axioms and inference rules.
  <LI><A HREF="mp-rewrite.html">The <TT>rewrite</TT> directive</A>
  defines <I>computational equivalences.</I>
  <LI><A HREF="mp-modules.html">The <TT>include</TT> directive</A>
  defines logical dependencies between modules.
  <LI><A HREF="mp-editor.html">The editor</A> provides navigation
  of the theory hierarchy, and interactive proof editing.
