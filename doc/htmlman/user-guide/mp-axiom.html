<H2>MetaPRL Inference Rules</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>The MetaPRL <I>meta</I>-logic defines a higher order logic
of <I>Horn</I> formulas. The logic includes a <I>term</I> language,
described in the page on <A HREF="mp-terms.html">MetaPRL terms</A>,
and a meta-logic defined with a meta-implication over second-order
term patterns. Each inference rule in a theory defines
a set of valid inferences in the logic. At the moment, inferences
are non-recursive: they have the syntax:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>inference</I> ::= <I>term | term</I> <TT>--&gt;
  </TT><I>inference</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A <I>theory</I> is defined by stating its inference
rules. Some times we call an inference rule that is just a single
term an <I>axiom</I> (axioms don't use the meta-implication). The theories are modular:
each module defines a theory that contains the rules defined in
the module, and in all ancestor modules. The module system is
discussed in the <A HREF="mp-modules.html">module system page</A>.</P>

<H3>Interface</H3>

<P>A module interface declares the <I>signature</I> of a theory;
it includes declarations for each of the <I>public</I>
inference rules. Rules are not required to be listed in an
interface, but for clarity, many of the theories in MetaPRL,
including <TT>Itt_theory</TT>, include the inference rule declarations
in their signatures.</P>

<P>Inference rules are declared with the <TT>rule</TT>
form. The general syntax is the following:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><B>rule</B> <I>name</I> [<I>params</I>] : <I>inference</I></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <I>params</I> are extra parameters that are passed to the
inference rule, including <I>context</I> addresses, <I>term</I>
arguments, and <I>new variable</I> names. The <TT>Itt_struct</TT>
module contains a basic rule:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><B>rule</B> hypothesis 'H 'J 'x :
   <B>sequent</B> ['ext] { 'H; x: 'A; 'J['x] &gt;- 'A }</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <I>name</I> of the rule is <TT>hypothesis</TT>. The parameters
include two context identifiers <TT>'H</TT> and <TT>'J</TT>, and
a variable identifier <TT>'x</TT>. The inference of this rule
defines a set of <I>sequents</I>, containing a number of hypotheses
defined by the context <TT>'H</TT>, a single hypothesis <TT>x</TT>
of type <TT>'A</TT>, additional hypotheses defined by the context
<TT>'J['x]</TT>, where the variable <TT>x</TT> may occur free,
and a single conclusion <TT>'A</TT>. The sequent also contains
an extra parameter <TT>'ext</TT> that defines the <I>computational
status</I> in the <TT><A HREF="../system/mp-itt.html">Itt_theory</A></TT>.
The parameter is the term <TT>squash</TT> if the sequent has no
computational value, and it is a variable otherwise (in this case
the variable <TT>'ext</TT>).</P>

<P>The <TT>hypothesis</TT> rule defines a set of valid inferences
defined by the terms that is matches. Put another way, the inference
states that all <I>substitution instances</I> are valid formulas,
where the contexts <TT>'H</TT> and <TT>'J['x]</TT> are replaced
by lists of hypotheses, the variable <TT>'A</TT> is replaced by
a term, the variable <TT>'x</TT> is replaced by another variable
and the variable <TT>'ext</TT> is replaced by arbitrary term.
For instance, the following formulas are valid in the <TT>Itt_struct</TT>
module:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <DL>
    <DT><B><TT>sequent </TT></B><TT>['ext] { i: int; z: false &gt;-
    false }</TT>
    <DT><B><TT>sequent </TT></B><TT>[squash] { z: 1; y: 'z + 1 &gt;-
    1 }</TT>
  </DL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The second example is strange because <TT>1</TT> is not a type.
However, the semantics of sequents in the <TT>Itt_theory</TT> theory
validates the truth of the expression. A hypothesis <TT>(x:'A)</TT>
in the <TT>Itt</TT> theory implies two assumptions: that <TT>'A</TT>
is a type, and that <TT>'A</TT> is true. If <TT>'A</TT> is not
a type, the assumption is false, so the sequent is trivially true.</P>

<P>Inference rules are also defined using the <TT>rule</TT> directive.
An inference is a <I>conditional</I> rule; it states assumptions
that must be proved in order for the conclusion to hold. Most introduction
and elimination rules have this form. For example, in the <TT>Itt_logic</TT>
module, the introduction rule for logical conjunction is stated
as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><B>rule</B> and_intro 'H :
   sequent ['ext] { 'H &gt;- 'a1 } --&gt;
   sequent ['ext] { 'H &gt;- 'a2 } --&gt;
   sequent ['ext] { 'H &gt;- &quot;and&quot;{'a1; 'a2} }</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <TT>'H</TT> is the context identifier used to instantiate
the hypotheses, and the <TT>'a1</TT> and <TT>'a2</TT> terms are
the subterms of the conjunction. The rule states that in order
to prove the conjunction <TT>'a1 &amp; 'a2</TT> in any context
<TT>'H</TT>, it is sufficient to prove <TT>'a1</TT> and <TT>'a2</TT>
in the same context.</P>

<P>The <TT>meta-prl/doc/private/sequents.tex</TT> file gives the formal definition of
the complete rule syntax.</P>

<H3>Implementation</H3>

<P>Inference rules are implemented two ways: they can
be derived from previous rules and they can be declared as <I>primitive</I>
axioms of a theory. The difference between these two forms is in
the way the system does logical accounting.</P>

<P>A primitive inference is &quot;justified&quot; by giving a
relation on <I>proofs</I> with the <TT>prim</TT> form, which has
the following syntax:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><B>prim</B> <I>name</I> [<I>params</I>] : <I>binference</I> = <I>term</I></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A <I>binference</I> is like an inference, but it contains bindings
for the proofs. The bindings are bound in the <I>term</I> part
of the <TT>prim</TT> form, which provides the final proof term.
In constructive theories, the &quot;proof&quot; is usually the proof
<I>extract:</I> a term that defines the computational content
of the proof. For example, the following definition gives an implementation
of the <TT>and_intro</TT> rule declared above:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><B><TT>prim</TT></B><TT> and_intro 'H :</TT>
<TT>   ('t1 : sequent ['ext] { 'H &gt;- 'a1 }) --&gt;</TT>
<TT>   ('t2 : sequent ['ext] { 'H &gt;- 'a2 }) --&gt;</TT>
<TT>   sequent ['ext] { 'H &gt;- &quot;and&quot;{'a1; 'a2} } =</TT>
<TT>   pair{'t1; 't2}</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <TT>pair</TT> term is the proof term of the proof: if <TT>'t1</TT>
is a proof of <TT>'a1</TT>, and <TT>'t2</TT> is a proof of <TT>'a2</TT>,
then <TT>pair{'t1; 't2}</TT> is a proof of <TT>'a1 &amp; 'a2</TT>.
The proof term is especially useful in constructive theories; in
classical theories the proof term may just be a <I>canonical</I>
proof term, indicating the truth of the proof statement without
any computational value.</P>

<P>The system automatically constructs proof terms for complete
proofs, using the constructions provided by the <TT>prim</TT>
form in the theory. Inferences can also be <I>derived</I> from
previous rules in a theory. Derived rules are declared with the
following form:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><B>interactive</B> <I>name</I> : [<I>params</I>] : <I>inference</I></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The interactive form has exactly the same form as an <TT>rule</TT>,
and it introduces a proof obligation. The proof is constructed
with the <A HREF="mp-editor.html">proof editor</A>.</P>

<H3>Tactics</H3>

<P>When an <TT>rule</TT> is declared, the system creates a <I>tactic</I>
that can be used to apply the rule. Tactics are the general reasoning
mechanism used for interactive proving. Tactics are ML programs,
and they can be combined with the <I>tacticals</I> in the <A HREF="../system/mp-tacticals.html">system description</A> to provide
automated proving.</P>

<P>Each inference rule declaration also provides a tactic
declaration. The exact form of the tactic depends on the types
of its parameters. A <I>context</I> parameter requires an <TT>address</TT>
argument, a <I>variable</I> parameter requires a string, and a
<I>term</I> argument requires a <TT>term</TT>. For instance, the
ML definitions provided by the rules above are the following:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><B>val</B> hypothesis : address -&gt; address -&gt; string -&gt; tactic
<B>val </B>and_intro : address -&gt; tactic
  </PRE>
