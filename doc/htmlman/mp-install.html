<H1 align="center">Installing MetaPRL</H1>

<I>Warning: MetaPRL is currently Beta and could still have some nasty bugs.</I>

<H2>Downloading MetaPRL</H2>

<P>In order to compile and run MetaPRL you are going to need the following packages:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Objective Caml: our version contains a small patch to CamlP4 to compile the
      CamlP4 distribution in native code.
  <LI>The OMake build system.
  <LI>OpenSSL libraries and header files are optional, but highly recommended.
  <LI>Ensemble: you need Ensemble only if you want to use the distributed prover.
  <LI>MetaPRL sources.
</OL>

<P>OCaml and OMake and are currently available as source, Red Hat Linux 7.x, 8.x and 9, and Fedora
Core 1 and 2 <A HREF="http://www.rpm.org">RPM</A> files for Linux x86. You can get the <a
href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/">rpm2html</a> listing of available RPMs and download them
from <A HREF="http://rpm.nogin.org/ocaml.html">http://rpm.nogin.org/ocaml.html</A> and <A
HREF="http://rpm.nogin.org/omake.html">http://rpm.nogin.org/omake.html</A> respectively or a plain
listing directly from <A
HREF="http://rpmbin.nogin.org/MetaPRL/">http://rpmbin.nogin.org/MetaPRL/</a>.  If you are going to
build OCaml yourself, you can get our patches at <A
HREF="http://cvs.metaprl.org:12000/cvsweb/metaprl/patches/">http://cvs.metaprl.org:12000/cvsweb/metaprl/patches/</A>
(see the <A HREF="http://cvs.metaprl.org:12000/cvsweb/~checkout~/metaprl/patches/README">README
file</A> for the list of patches you need to apply).</P>

<P>OCaml and OMake may also be obtained via the <a
  href="http://godi.ocaml-programming.de/">GODI Distribution Framework</a>.

<P>The Win32 binaries of OCaml and OMake are available at <A
HREF="http://files.metaprl.org/win32/">http://files.metaprl.org/win32/</A>.  Under Windows you will
need Microsoft Visual C/C++ installed, as well as the Microsoft Macro Assembler.
Alternatively, you
can use <a href="http://www.cygwin.org/">the Cygnus Systems GNU-Win32 distribution</a>, but the
performance (especially the compilation time) is likely to be noticeably worse.

<P>The OMake sources may also be downloaded via CVS (see <a href="#cvs">CVS instructions</a> below).

<P>You can download Ensemble from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/ensemble/">ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/ensemble/</A>.</P>

<P> If you are using a Unix-like operation system, you probably already have a copy of OpenSSL
around (note that you need the development files as well, which are often distributed in a separate
<tt>openssl-devel</tt> binary package).  OpenSSL for Windows is available at <a
href="http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html">http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html</a>.

<P>You should be able to download MetaPRL sources tarball from <A
HREF="http://files.metaprl.org/">http://files.metaprl.org/</A>, but if you plan to participate in
MetaPRL development, you should consider using <A HREF="#cvs">the CVS access</A> to MetaPRL
sources.</P>

<H3><A NAME="cvs">CVS Access to MetaPRL Sources</A></H3>

<p> You can <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://cvs.metaprl.org:12000/cvsweb/metaprl/">browse the MetaPRL CVS repository</a>.

<P>If you plan any development in MetaPRL or if you want to download the latest
version of MetaPRL, you may consider
using the public CVS repository. This will allow you to have access
to the latest changes in the distribution. The normal
service is read-only, but if you would like to become a contributor
with write access, read the <A HREF="mp-cvs-rw.html">read-write CVS instructions</A>.

<P>The CVS server is on the machine <TT>cvs.metaprl.org</TT>.
First log into the server by running

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.metaprl.org:/cvsroot login</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The password is empty. It will be stored on your computer,
so you only have to run the login command once.

<P>Now you can checkout the distribution by running:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.metaprl.org:/cvsroot checkout metaprl</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

From the same server you can also checkout the OMake distribution by running:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.metaprl.org:/cvsroot checkout omake</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You can find more information on CVS from
the <A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/">CVS Documentation Pages</A>
and from <A HREF="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/">The CVS Book</A>.

<H2>Installation and configuration</H2>

<h3>OCaml</h3>

<P>If you are not using
<A HREF="http://rpmbin.nogin.org/MetaPRL/">the provided RPMs</A>, then in order
to install OCaml and CamlP4 download and
unpack the distributions, than apply the <A
HREF="http://cvs.metaprl.org:12000/cvsweb/metaprl/patches/">patches</A> (see
the <A
HREF="http://cvs.metaprl.org:12000/cvsweb/~checkout~/metaprl/patches/README">README
file</A> for the list of patches you need to apply). After that, proceed as described in the
<TT>INSTALL</TT> files in the distributions. If your OS supports pthreads, run OCaml configure
script with <TT>-with-pthread</TT> option in order to get pthreads support in OCaml.
After you have compiled and installed OCaml and Camlp4, go to the OCaml source
tree and copy the following files:
<UL>
<LI><TT>parsing/location.cmi</TT>
<LI><TT>parsing/location.mli</TT>
<LI><TT>parsing/longident.cmi</TT>
<LI><TT>parsing/longident.mli</TT>
<LI><TT>parsing/parsetree.cmi</TT>
<LI><TT>parsing/parsetree.mli</TT>
<LI><TT>typing/typecore.cmi</TT>
<LI><TT>typing/typecore.mli</TT>
</UL> into the OCaml library directory.

<h3>OMake</h3>
To build OMake from sources change to the OMake source directory and run <tt>./configure</tt> followed by <tt>make</tt> and <tt>make install</tt>

<h3>Ensemble</h3>

<P>To install Ensemble, unpack the distribution, and edit the
<TT>&lt;ensemble&gt;/mk/config.mk</TT> file. You will want to
use the Ensemble socket library (not the Unix socket implementation),
then change directories to <TT>&lt;ensemble&gt;/def</TT>, and
run <TT>make</TT>. You can also build the native-code libraries
by running <TT>make</TT> in the <TT>&lt;ensemble&gt;/opt</TT>
directory. More information on Ensemble is available at the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Ensemble/">Ensemble
Home Page</A>.</P>

<h3>MetaPRL</h3>

<P>To install MetaPRL, unpack the distribution into some directory
<TT>&lt;metaprl&gt;</TT> and build the distribution with these steps:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>% cd &lt;metaprl&gt;</TT><BR>
<TT>% omake</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>After you run <TT>omake</tt> for the first time, it will create the
<tt>mk/config</tt> file (as well as an empty <TT>mk/config.local</TT> file)
that you will need to customize, before the <TT>omake</TT> process
can continue. The <tt>mk/config</tt> file is self-documenting.</P>

<P> If you are using Ensemble, set <TT>ENSROOT=&lt;root of the ensemble
source tree&gt;</TT> in the <TT>mk/config</TT> file.
</P>

<P>You may need to set variables <TT>CAMLLIB</TT> and <TT>CAMLP4LIB</TT> to
point to the directories where you have installed OCaml and Camlp4 files. You
can either set them in the <TT>mk/config.local</TT> file, for example:<br>
<code>CAMLLIB=/usr/lib/ocaml<br>
CAMLP4LIB=/usr/lib/ocaml/camlp4</code><br>
or in the environment. If a variable is set in both,
<TT>mk/config.local</tt> takes precedence over the environment.
The defaults are <TT>/usr/lib/ocaml</TT> and <TT>/usr/lib/ocaml/camlp4</TT>
respectively.</P>

<P> Additional configuration options might be necessary on Windows and Mac OS
X. See the corresponding <tt>README</tt> files in the top-level MetaPRL
directory for more information.</P>

<P>MetaPRL can be run with the <p>&lt;metaprl&gt;<tt>/editor/ml/mpopt</tt><p>
script (if <tt>NATIVE_ENABLED</tt> is switched on in <tt>mk/config</tt>), or
<tt>&lt;metaprl&gt;/editor/ml/mptop</tt> (if you have compiled MetaPRL with
<tt>BYTE_ENABLED</tt>).  By default, this will attempt to start your
browser or prompt you to connect using your browser. MetaPRL looks better if
you use Mozilla, but other browsers (including Konqueror and IE) are likely to
work as well.  Internet Explorer is known to work well when "Arial Unicode MS"
font is installed (arialuni.ttf is available on Microsoft Office CD inside
office1.cab; note that it is not always installed automatically with MS
Office) otherwise some symbols might not by displayed; some other "rich" font
might work as well.

<P>You don't have to use the browser.  You can also use the command-line
interface by running MetaPRL with the <tt>-cli</tt> option, which will expect
to be running in a console with Unicode fonts. To run <tt>mpopt -cli</tt> in
an <tt>xterm</tt> with the correct fonts, use
<TT>&lt;metaprl&gt;/editor/ml/mpxterm</TT> (normal fonts),
<TT>&lt;metaprl&gt;/editor/ml/mpxterm-large</TT> (larger font), or
<TT>&lt;metaprl&gt;/editor/ml/mpkonsole</TT> (to run in KDE's
<tt>konsole</tt>)</P>

<P>If starting MetaPRL by hands (or from Emacs), the programs to use are
<TT>&lt;metaprl&gt;/editor/ml/mpopt</TT> (native code) and
<TT>&lt;metaprl&gt;/editor/ml/mptop</TT> (bytecode).  You will need to use a
Unicode (<tt>iso10646-1</tt>) font to be able to interact with some sense. We
currently recommend using the
<TT>-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1</TT> font
(which is what <TT>mpxterm</TT> script uses), but in some cases another font
may work better.</P>

<P>That's it. To navigate the MetaPRL logics and programs, you will need to
read the <TT>&lt;metaprl&gt;/editor/ml/QUICKSTART</TT> file or the <A
TARGET="_top" HREF="user-guide/default.html">User Guide</A>.  To start
developing new code, read the <A TARGET="_top"
HREF="developer-guide/default.html">Developer Guide</A>.</P>

<P>If you need help installing MetaPRL, please feel free to contact us at
<TT>metaprl at metaprl.org</TT>.
