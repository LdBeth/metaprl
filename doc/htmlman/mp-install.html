<H3>Download MetaPRL</H3>

<P>MetaPRL can be downloaded from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/nuprl/MetaPRL/">ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/nuprl/MetaPRL/</A>.
You will need four packages:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Objective Caml: our version contains a small
  native code profiler patch.
  <LI>CamlP4: our version contains a small patch to compile the
  CamlP4 distribution in native code, native code profiler patch
  and a patch to install interface files needed by MetaPRL to evaluate programs in the toploop
  <LI>Ensemble: you need Ensemble only if you want to use the distributed
  prover.
  <LI>MetaPRL
</OL>

<P>All source modules are available as source, and RedHat 5.x
RPM packages files for Linux x86 at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/nuprl/MetaPRL/RPM/">ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/nuprl/MetaPRL/RPM/</A>. There is also a Win32 distribution
that we'll be placing online soon (if you don't see it contact
<A HREF="mailto:jyh@cs.cornell.edu">Jason Hickey</A>). You will
need the Cygnus Systems GNU-Win32 distribution.</P> If you are going to build OCaml and/or Camlp4 yourself, you can get our patches at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/nuprl/MetaPRL/patches/">ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/nuprl/MetaPRL/patches/</A>

<H4>CVS sources</H4>

<p> You can <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://ensemble01.cs.cornell.edu:12000/cvsweb/meta-prl/">browse the MetaPRL CVS repository</a>.

<P>If you plan any development in MetaPRL, you may consider
using the public CVS repository. This will allow you to have access 
to the latest changes in the distribution. The normal
service is read-only, but if you would like to become a contributor
with write access, contact <A HREF="mailto:jyh@cs.cornell.edu">Jason
Hickey</A> or <A HREF="mailto:nogin@cs.cornell.edu">Alexey Nogin</A>.

<P>The CVS server is on the machine <TT>ensemble01.cs.cornell.edu</TT>. 
First log into the server by running

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@ensemble01.cs.cornell.edu:/cvsroot login</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The password is <TT>anoncvs</TT>. It will be stored on your computer, 
so you only have to run the login command once.

<P>Now you can checkout the distribution by running:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@ensemble01.cs.cornell.edu:/cvsroot checkout MetaPRL</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

You can find more information on CVS at 
<A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/info.html">Cyclic Software's pages</A>

<H4>Installation and configuration</H4>

<P>If your are not using 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/nuprl/MetaPRL/RPM/">the provided RPMs</A>, then in order
to install OCaml and CamlP4 download and 
unpack the distributions, than apply the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/nuprl/MetaPRL/patches/">patches</A>. After that proceed as described in the 
<TT>INSTALL</TT> files in the distributions. </P>

<P>To install Ensemble, unpack the distrubution, and edit the
<TT>&lt;ensemble&gt;/mk/config.mk</TT> file. You will want to
use the Ensemble socket library (not the Unix socket implementation),
then change directories to <TT>&lt;ensemble&gt;/def</TT>, and
run <TT>make</TT>. You can also build the native-code libraries
by running <TT>make</TT> in the <TT>&lt;ensemble&gt;/opt</TT>
directory. More information on Ensemble is available at the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Ensemble/">Ensemble
Home Page</A>.</P>

<P>You may need to set your environment variables <TT>CAMLLIB</TT> and <TT>CAMLP4LIB</TT> to point to the directories where you have installed OCaml and Camlp4 files. The defaults are <TT>/usr/lib/ocaml</TT> and <TT>/usr/lib/camlp4</TT> respectively. If you are using Ensemble, set <TT>ENSROOT=&lt;root of the ensemble source tree&gt;</TT>
Also, go to the OCaml source tree and copy the folowing files:
<UL><TT>
<LI>parsing/location.cmi
<LI>parsing/location.mli
<LI>parsing/longident.cmi
<LI>parsing/longident.mli
<LI>parsing/parsetree.cmi
<LI>parsing/parsetree.mli
<LI>typing/typecore.cmi
<LI>typing/typecore.mli</TT>
</UL> into the <TT>$CAMLLIB</TT> directory

</P>

<P>To install MetaPRL, unpack the distribution into some directory
<TT>&lt;meta-prl&gt;</TT> and build the distribution with these steps:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>% cd &lt;meta-prl&gt;<BR>
% make all</TT> &nbsp; (builds bytecode)<BR>
or<BR>
<TT>% make opt</TT> &nbsp; (builds native code)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The MetaPRL programs are <TT>&lt;meta-prl&gt;/editor/ml/mptop</TT> (bytecode) and  <TT>&lt;meta-prl&gt;/editor/ml/mpopt</TT> (native code).
You will need to install the &quot;MetaPRL font&quot; to be able
to interact with some sense. The MetaPRL font is in <TT>&lt;meta-prl&gt;/editor/fonts/mp12.bdf</TT>.
You'll get the best success if you use MetaPRL from a shell
window within Emacs. You can start Emacs with the MetaPRL font by
running <TT>emacs -fn mp12</TT>.</P>

<P>That's it. To navigate the MetaPRL logics and programs,
you will need to read the <A TARGET="_top" HREF="user-guide/default.html">User Guide</A>.
