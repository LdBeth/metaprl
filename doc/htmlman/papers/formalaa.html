<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
Our goal is to develop a general formalization of abstract algebra suitable
for a general reasoning. One of the most common ways to formalize abstract
algebra is to make use of a module system to specify an algebra as a theory.
However, this approach suffers from the fact that modules are usually not
first-class objects in the formal system. In this paper, we develop a new
approach based on the use of dependent record types. In our account, all
algebraic structures are first-class objects, with the natural subtyping
properties due to record extension (for example, a group is a subtype of a
monoid). Our formalization cleanly separates the axiomatization of the algebra
from its typing properties, corresponding more closely to a textbook
presentation.
