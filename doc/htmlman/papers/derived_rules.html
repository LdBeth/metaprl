<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This paper presents a general <em>sequent schema</em> language that can be
   used for specifying sequent&ndash;style rules for a logical theory. We show
   how by adding the <em>sequent schema</em> language to a theory we gain an
   ability to prove new inference rules within the theory itself. We show that
   the extension of any such theory with our <em>sequent schema</em> language
   and with any new rules found using this mechanism is <em>conservative</em>.
</p>

<p>By using the <em>sequent schema</em> language in a theorem prover, one gets
   an ability to allow users to derive new rules and then use such derived
   rules as if they were primitive axioms. The conservativity result
   guarantees the validity of such approach. This property makes it a
   convenient tool for implementing a derived rules mechanism in theorem
   provers, especially considering that the application of the rules expressed
   in the <em>sequent schema</em> language can be efficiently implemented
   using <a href="http://metaprl.org">MetaPRL</a>'s
   <a href="fast_proving.html">fast rewriting engine</a>.
