<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
We present the design of a formal integrated design environment.  The
long-term goal of this effort is to allow seamless interaction between
software production tools and formal design and analysis tools, especially
between compilers and higher-order theorem provers.  The work in this report
is the initial design and architecture for integration of
<ol>
<li> the <a href="http://metaprl.org/">MetaPRL logical framework</a>,
<li> a multi-language compiler we call Mojave, and
<li> a generic extensible parser we call Phobos.
</ol>
The integration is currently performed at the level of the Mojave functional
intermediate representation, allowing the use of the theorem prover for
program analysis, transformation, and optimization.
