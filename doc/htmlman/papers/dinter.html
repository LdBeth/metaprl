<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Records and dependent records are a powerful tool for programming,
representing mathematical concepts, and program verification. In the last
decade several type systems with records as primitive types were proposed. The
question is arose: whether it is possible to define record type in existent
type theories using standard types without introducing new primitives.</p>
<p>It was known that <i>independent</i> records can be defined in type
theories with dependent functions or intersection. On the other hand
<i>dependent</i> records cannot be formed using standard types.  Hickey
introduced a complex notion of <i>very dependent functions</i> to represent
dependent records. In the current paper we extend Martin-L&ouml;f type theory
with a simpler type constructor <i> dependent intersection</i>, i.e., the
intersection of <i>two</i> types, where the second type may depend on
elements of  the  first one (not to be confused with the intersection of a
family of types). This new type constructor allows us to define dependent
records in a very simple way. It also  allows us to define the set type
constructor.</p>
