<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent years, there have been many examples of significant formalization
efforts in higher-order logics, including the formalization of Java, the
verification of the SCI cache-coherency protocol, the verification of the
AAMP5 avionics processor in PVS, the verification and automated optimization
of Ensemble protocols, and many others. Higher-order logics are often chosen
for these endeavors not only because they can formalize meta-principles, but
also because they retain the conciseness and intuition of the original design.

<p>While this model has been successful, it is expensive. We present an
architecture, implemented in the <a href="http://metaprl.org">MetaPRL logical
framework</a>, for distributing tactic proving over large groups of processors
using the Ensemble group communication system. To counteract problems of
reliability in distributed environments, we use Ensemble's fault recovery
support. To preserve the large existing tactic base, we replace the existing
tactic implementation with a functionally equivalent distributed tactic
scheduler.
