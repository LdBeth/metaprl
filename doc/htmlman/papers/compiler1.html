<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
The task of designing and implementing a compiler can be a difficult and
error-prone process.  In this paper, we present a new approach based on the
use of higher-order abstract syntax and term rewriting in a logical framework.
All program transformations, from parsing to code generation, are cleanly
isolated and specified as term rewrites.  This has several advantages.  The
correctness of the compiler depends solely on a small set of rewrite rules
that are written in the language of formal mathematics.  In addition, the
logical framework guarantees the preservation of scoping, and it automates
many frequently-occurring tasks including substitution and rewriting
strategies.  As we show, compiler development in a logical framework can be
<em>easier</em> than in a general-purpose language like ML, in part because of
automation, and also because the framework provides extensive support for
examination, validation, and debugging of the compiler transformations.  The
paper is organized around a case study, using the <a
href="http://metaprl.org">MetaPRL logical framework</a> to compile an ML-like
language to Intel x86 assembly.  We also present a scoped formalization of x86
assembly in which all registers are immutable.
