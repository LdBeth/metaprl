<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Formal methods are successfully used in a wide range of applications
&mdash; from hardware and software verification to formalizing mathematics and
education.  However their impact is limited and is very far from realizing the
full potential of formal methods. Our investigation of these limitations shows
that they can not be avoided by simply fine-tuning existing tools and methods.
We demonstrate the need to concentrate on improving and extending the
underlying theory and methodology of computer-aided formal reasoning.</p>

<p>This thesis explores both practical and theoretical aspects of achieving
these improvements; we present solutions for some of the outstanding problems
and substantial improvements for others. In particular, we improve
axiomatizations of the extant logics to make them more accessible to both
users of the system and proof automating procedures. We also present methods
for very significant speedup of the proof search process. Such additional
speed means not only that the theorem prover will work faster, but also users
can now take advantage of more advanced proof automation procedures that would
have been prohibitively slow otherwise.</p>

<p>This thesis also demonstrates how these wide ranging practical and
theoretical
results can be brought together in a more efficient and more generic
tactic-based formal system.  In particular, we present a generic derived rules
mechanism and explain how such a mechanism can facilitate practical
modularization of a formal system. We also present several approaches to
establishing a generic layer of proof automation procedures (<em>tactics</em>)
that apply to a wide variety of logical theories.  Most of the ideas presented
in this thesis were implemented in the <a
href="http://metaprl.org">MetaPRL</a> logical framework taking advantage of an
existing modular flexible design and making it even more modular and more
flexible.</p>

<p>After implementing these ideas in the <a
href="http://metaprl.org">MetaPRL</a> logical framework, we use that system to
improve a formalization of NuPRL intuitionistic type theory. In particular, we
show how to modularize an axiomatization of a quotient type thus creating a
formalization capable of expressing important concepts that were impossible to
express in the original monolithic axiomatization. We also show how to add a
limited form of classical reasoning to an intuitionistic type theory in a way
that preserves many constructive aspects of the theory. Several theorems in
this thesis were formally proven in the <a
href="http://metaprl.org">MetaPRL</a> system.</p>
