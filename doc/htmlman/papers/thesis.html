in this thesis were implemented in the <a
href="http://metaprl.org">MetaPRL</a> logical framework taking advantage of an
existing modular flexible design and making it even more modular and more
flexible.</p>

<p>After implementing these ideas in the <a
href="http://metaprl.org">MetaPRL</a> logical framework, we use that system to
improve a formalization of NuPRL intuitionistic type theory. In particular, we
show how to modularize an axiomatization of a quotient type thus creating a
formalization capable of expressing important concepts that were impossible to
express in the original monolithic axiomatization. We also show how to add a
limited form of classical reasoning to an intuitionistic type theory in a way
that preserves many constructive aspects of the theory. Several theorems in
this thesis were formally proven in the <a
href="http://metaprl.org">MetaPRL</a> system.</p>
