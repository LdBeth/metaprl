<p> I would like to thank here my teachers I had in my life. First of
all, I am thankful to my parents Pavel Kopylov and Ekaterina
Gamazova. They inculcated in me a taste for mathematics in my early
ages. For example, when I was a little
boy, my father brought me a pair of sand-glasses. I played with them
and came up with different puzzles, like
<i>how to measure eleven minutes using sand-glasses for three and ten
minutes?</i>
My father also taught me programming in Pascal when we did not have a
computer.<br>
<br>
I am also thankful to Raymond Smullyan, although I never met him in
person. My early interest in mathematics is partially due to his great
book ---
<i>What Is the Name of This Book?</i> --- with logical puzzles about
knights and knaves. My father read me the problems from this book (I
could hardly read
at that time) and I competed with my mother trying to solve the
problems first.<br>
<br>
My special thanks are due to my school math teacher Alexandr
Nikolaevich
Zemlyakov ``Zemmm''. I admire his mathematical taste and his teaching
style.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately some people who had great influence on me are already
passed away.
I am very grateful to my grandfather Andrei Konstantinovich Gamazov,
who was a great teacher, I am very proud of him. I am also very
grateful
to my other grandfather Nikolai Georgievivh Kopylov, who taught me
chess. My schoolfriend Ivan Soloviev had a big influence on me. He was
one year
older than me and was always a step ahead of me in mathematical
Olympics.<br>
<br>
I am thankful to my Moscow adviser Sergei Artemov. He helped me a <b>lot</b>
both in
Moscow and at Cornell. Thanks to him I am here. I owe many thanks to my
Cornell adviser Robert Constable for his guidance and many useful
discussions.<br>
<br>
I was very pleased to work with my colleague and namesake (although he
spells his name differently) Aleksey Nogin. Part of the thesis is a
joint
work with Aleksey. Many thanks are due to my other colleague Jason
Hickey for his discussions and early appreciation of my work.<br>
<br>
I am also thankful to Christoph Kreitz and Stuart Allen for reading and
reviewing my work.
I want to thank many other Cornellians included: Anil Nerode and Jon
Kleinberg for serving on my committee,
Dexter Kozen who said that ``a computer scientist is a mathematician
with a job'',
Evan Moran for his comments on my work during PRL seminars, Mark
Bickford, working with him was a pleasure,
Pavel Naumov and Lena Safirova for their help during my first year at
Cornell, Alexandre Evfimievski for his sharp criticism, and many
others.
<br>
<br>
I also want to thank the PRL seminar for giving me a forum for
presenting my ideas and helping me refine them --- especially the long
series on objects.<br>
<br>

Research Initiative (MURI) program administered by the Office of Naval
Research (ONR) under Grant N00014-01-1-0765, the Defense Advanced
