<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Theorem provers for higher-order logics often use <em>tactics</em> to
implement automated proof search. Often some basic tactics are designed to
behave very differently in different contexts. Even in a prover that only
supports a fixed base logic, such tactics may need to be updated
dynamically as new definitions and theorems are added. In a logical
framework with multiple (perhaps conflicting) logics, this has the added
complexity that definitions and theorems should only be used for automation
only in the logic in which they are defined or proved.
</p>

<p>
This paper describes a very general and flexible mechanism for extensible
hierarchical tactic maintenance in a logical framework. We also explain how
this reflective mechanism can be implemented efficiently while requiring
little effort from its users.
</p>

<p>
The approaches presented in this paper form the core of the tactic
construction methodology in the <a href="http://metaprl.org/">MetaPRL theorem
prover</a>, where they have been developed and successfully used for several
years.
