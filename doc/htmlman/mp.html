<H1 align="center">Welcome to MetaPRL</H1>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALT="MetaPRL Banner" SRC="images/mp-logo.gif" WIDTH="533" HEIGHT="194" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>

<P>MetaPRL is two things: it is a <I>logical framework</I>
where multiple logics can be defined and related, and it is a
<I>system implementation</I> with support for interactive proof
and automated reasoning. A primary feature of MetaPRL is a
semantic connection to programming languages, that allows the
system to be used as a <I>logical programming environment</I>,
where programs are constructed as a mixture of specifications,
implementations, and verifications.</P>

<H2><A NAME="anchor2479740">System goals</A></H2>

<P>The MetaPRL system was implemented with the purpose of
supporting <I>relations</I> between logics. There is a huge investment
in formal work in systems like PVS, HOL, Coq, ELF, Nuprl, and
others. These systems use different logics and different methodologies,
but they have common goals and their results share fundamental
mathematical underpinnings. Mathematical developments are expensive;
our first goal is to expose the logical foundations that the systems
share, to allow the <I>results</I> to be shared between systems.
MetaPRL supports sharing with three features:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Programs and logics are developed as modules that define
  <I>computational, heuristic,</I> and <I>mathematical</I> properties.
  <LI>Modules are constructed <I>incrementally</I> by adding formal
  properties to existing modules (the empty module is the root
  of every logic). Just as object-oriented programming allows code
  re-use, incremental module construction allows <I>logical</I>
  re-use: logics can share a common core with properties that are
  <I>inherited</I> as the logics are extended.
  <LI>Modules are <I>first-class:</I> relations between logics
  are either constructed by inheritance, or explicitly constructed
  as functions between modules.
</UL>

<P>This first goal give formal underpinnings to logical sharing;
our next goal is to provide practical impact. Work is underway
to relate the PVS, HOL, Isabelle, and Nuprl mathematical foundations.
Precursors to these developments are available in the MetaPRL
distribution, including logics for:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>constructive type theory (ITT), based on the Martin-Lof style
  Nuprl type theory,
  <LI>constructive set theory, based on Aczel's axiomatization,
  <LI>the LF logical framework,
  <LI>first order logic.
</UL>

<P>These logics provide the principles of formal logical relations.
Aczel's set theory is modeled in the type theory (as is first-order
logic). The LF work is less complete.</P>

<P>Our work focuses specifically on <I>programming:</I> even though
large-scale programming is unreliable, the advantage of high-speed
automation has pushed computation into our safety-critical infrastructure,
including the telephone system, the power grid, the financial
sector, and the transportation industry. The reliability of critical
systems must be ensured--while retaining productivity. MetaPRL
addresses the problem in two ways:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The system provides a semantic framework to allow program
  <I>development</I> in an environment of mixed specification and
  implementation. Logical foundations are used both to guide the
  development and to ensure the reliability of developing software.
  The distribution contains a semantic account of core OCaml that
  allows ML programs to be intermixed with specifications in type
  theory.
  <LI>The majority of existing code is poorly documented and poorly
  structured. While this is the most speculative of our projects,
  MetaPRL supports the <I>hardening</I> of existing code by
  developing program-specific type systems that verify program
  abstractions.
</UL>

<P>Finally, our goal is <I>speed.</I> Higher-order formal systems
require a mixture of interactive and automated proving; the load
on the programmer is proportional to how efficient the system
is in deriving formal properties. MetaPRL focuses on this
problem at its foundation with these features:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Modularity is used to provide domain-specific heuristics
  and algorithms, and to restrict the logical search complexity.
  <LI>The implementation language, OCaml, provides performance
  close to C, but with a formal semantics, type safety, modularity,
  and extensive checking to assist code modification and development.
  <LI>Abstract data structures provide optimized domain-specific
  logical operations.
  <LI>MetaPRL is a fully-distributed, fault-tolerant theorem
  prover. The distribution over Ensemble scales to over 100 machines
  over a wide-area network (depending on the parallel properties
  of the domain problem). Faults are tolerated transparently: processors
  may join and leave a process group arbitrarily--problem outcomes
  are not affected by process failures. Furthermore, the distribution
  is transparent: programmers use the standard search language.
