<H3>Download Nuprl-Light</H3>

<P>Nuprl-Light can be downloaded at ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/jyh/nuprl-light.
You will need three packages:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Objective Caml: our version contains a small patch to install
  interface files needed by Nuprl-Light to evaluate programs in
  the toploop.
  <LI>CamlP4: our version contains a small patch to compile the
  CamlP4 distribution in native code.
  <LI>Ensemble: you need Ensemble only if you want to use the distributed
  prover.
  <LI>Nuprl-Light
</OL>

<P>All source modules are available as source, and RedHat 5.1
RPM packages files for Linux i386. There is also a Win32 distribution
that we'll be placing online soon (if you don't see it contact
<A HREF="mailto:jyh@cs.cornell.edu">Jason Hickey</A>). You will
need the Cygnus Systems GNU-Win32 distribution.</P>

<H4>CVS sources</H4>

<P>If you plan any development in Nuprl-Light, you may consider
using the public CVS repository. This will allow you to use CVS
to manage patches as the main distribution is updated. The normal
service is read-only, but if you would like to become a contributor
with write access, contact <A HREF="mailto:jyh@cs.cornell.edu">Jason
Hickey</A> ro <A HREF="mailto:nogin@cs.cornell.edu">Alexey Nogin</A>.
You will need <TT>ssh</TT> for your remote login program. The
CVS server is at port 80 on the machine <TT>ensemble01.cs.cornell.edu</TT>.
Install <TT>ssh</TT>, and create an executable shell script called
<TT>ssh.cvs</TT> containing these lines:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>#!/bin/sh
ssh -C -p 80</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You can checkout the distribution by running:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>% setenv CVS_RSH ssh.cvs
% cvs -d :ext:ensemble01.cs.cornell.edu:/cvsroot checkout nuprl-light</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Installation and configuration</H4>

<P>To install OCaml and CamlP4, unpack the distributions. The
<TT>INSTALL</TT> files describe the process of installation.</P>

<P>To install Ensemble, unpack the distrubution, and edit the
<TT>&lt;ensemble&gt;/mk/config.mk</TT> file. You will want to
use the Ensemble socket library (not the Unix socket implementation),
then change directories to <TT>&lt;ensemble&gt;/def</TT>, and
run <TT>make</TT>. You can also build the native-code libraries
by running <TT>make</TT> in the <TT>&lt;ensemble&gt;/opt</TT>
directory. More information on Ensemble is available at the Ensemble
Home Page.</P>

<P>To install Nuprl-Light, unpack the distribution into some directory
<TT>&lt;nuprl-light&gt;</TT>. You need to set the environment
variables <TT>CAMLLIB=&lt;your ocaml lib directory&gt;</TT>, and
<TT>ENSROOT=&lt;root of the ensemble source tree&gt;</TT>. Then
you can build the distribution with these steps:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>% cd &lt;nuprl-light&gt;
% make depend
% make all
or
% make opt</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The Nuprl-Light program is <TT>&lt;nuprl-light&gt;/editor/ml/nl</TT>.
You will need to install the &quot;Nuprl font&quot; to be able
to interact with some sense. The Nuprl font is in <TT>&lt;nuprl-light&gt;/editor/fonts/nl12.bdf</TT>.
You'll get the best success if you use Nuprl-Light from a shell
window within Emacs. You can start Emacs with the Nuprl font by
running <TT>emacs -fn nl12</TT>.</P>

<P>That's it. To navigate the Nuprl-Light logics and programs,
you will need to read the User Guide.
