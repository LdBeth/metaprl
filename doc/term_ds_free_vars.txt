Free Variables Calculation in the Term_ds Module

In the Term_ds module term and bound_term types have a field for storing the set
of free variables. This field is supposed to be either VarsDelayed if the set
was not computed yet or (Vars s) where s is the set variable names (strings) of
all first-order variables occurring free in the term (bound_term). 

The rules for calculating free variables sets are simple:
 - Free variables set of an ordinary term is a union of the free variables of
   its term_terms
 - Free variables set of an ordinary bound_term contains all variables of 
   its bterm excepts for those that become bound in this bound_term (its bvars).
 - Free variables set of a TVar v is a singleton set consisting of v.
 - Free variables set of a substitution is equal to the free variables set
   of the result of this substitution (cf. also Note 2)

Example:

"exists x . (x = y)" :

{ free_vars = {"y"}; core = Term
    { opname = "exists"; term_terms =
        [{ bfree_vars = ["y"]; bcore = BTerm
            { bvars = "x"; bterm =
                { free_vars={"x","y"}; core = Term
                    { opname = "equal"; term_terms =
                        [ { bfree_vars = {"x"}; bcore = BTerm
                            { bvars = []; bterm = 
                                { free_vars = {"x"}; core = TVar "x" } } };
                          { bfree_vars = {"y"}; bcore = BTerm
                            { bvars = []; bterm = 
                                { free_vars = {"y"}; core = TVar "y" } } } ] } } } } ] } }

(Here ``opaname = "..."'' is used as an abbrevation for 
   ``term_op = {op_opname = "..."; op_params = []}'' )

Notes:

1) Term_ds tries to distinguish a first-order variable "x" (has a free occurrence
of "x") and 0-ary second-order variable "x" (does not have any free variables).
FO variable "x" is represented as a "special" term (core = TVar "x") while 
SO variable "x" is represented as a "usual" term (core = Term t, where t 
is a term with opname "var", parameter (Var "x") and no subterms)

Since both are indistinguishable in the Term_std, sometimes Term_ds would use
TVar "x" (and consider it a free occurrence of "x") when "x" is actually an SO
variable.

2) When the Subst (or BSubst) is created, we first remove all "garbage" from
the substitution making sure that all variables that are being substituted 
for actually occur in the term. That makes computing the free variables set
of the substitution easier.
