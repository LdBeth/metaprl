Nuprl-Light Term Modules and Types

NL terms have an interface (type term') and internal (type term)   
representations. The term' type is defined in
refiner/refsig/term_simple_sig.mlz and is fixed while the term type may be
different in different modules. In the Term_std module (actually, it is
not a single module, but a collection of several modules, files in
refiner/term_std/) term is just equal to term'. In the Term_ds module   
("ds" stands for delayed substitutions", files in refiner/term_ds/) term
type is different from term' - term has a field for set of free variables
(which is computed lazily) and a field "core" that carries either term' or
a delayed substitution or a sequent or a variable (in Term_std variables
and sequents are encoded with term' s, but is turned out to be more
efficient to handle them specially). There are also some parts of the term
module that do not have to know what the term is and they work through the
term' interface type - these files are located in refiner/term_gen. The
parts of the term module are collected together and packed with refiner
and rewriter in refiner/refiner/refiner* files.
