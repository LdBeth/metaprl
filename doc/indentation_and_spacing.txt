Here is the list of basic indentation and spacing principles
that we try to observe in MetaPRL:

- All indentation steps are 3 spaces.

- No tab symbols in the code.

- No spaces at the end of a line.

- It's OK to use spaces to make sure pieces of code are nicely aligned
  and/or indented, but in all other case at most one single space
  sould be use, not several consecutive ones

- No empty lines at the beginning of a file, at the end of a file,
  or in the middle of a function. 

- Functions are usually separated by an empty line.

- No more than one or two consecutive empty lines.

- Patterns are indented as follows:

match
   expression
with
   Choice1 ->
      code1
 | Choice2 ->
      code2
 | Choice3 ...

When expression is short, its OK to use

match expression with
   Choice1 ->
...

When code_i is short, it's usually OK to put it on the same
line with Code_i (but not with Code_i+1).

- let constructions should be aligned as follows:

let variable = 
   expression
in
   code

if experession is short, it's OK to use either

let variable = expression in
code

or

let variable = expression in code

or even

let variable = expression
in code

On the other hand, the following is discoraged:

let very_long_variable_name = { field1 = code1;
                                field2 = code2.1...
                                         code2.2...
                                    .....

since it pushes the code to far to the right and makes it very
hard to read in a narrow window.

Instead, use

let very_long_variable_name = 
 { field1 = code1;
   field2 = 
      code2.1...
      code2.2...
    ...
