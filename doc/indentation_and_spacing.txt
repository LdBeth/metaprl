Here is the list of basic indentation and spacing principles
that we try to observe in MetaPRL:

- All indentation steps are 3 spaces.

- No tab symbols in the code.

- No spaces at the end of a line.

- More than one consecutive space may only be used at the beginning
  of a line, but not in the middle.

- No empty lines at the beginning of a file, at the end of a file,
  or in the middle of a function. 

- Functions are usually separated by an empty line.

- No more than one or two consecutive empty lines.

- Patterns are indented as follows:

match
   expression
with
   Choice1 ->
      code1
 | Choice2 ->
      code2
 | Choice3 ...

When expression is short, its OK to put
match expression with
on a single line.

When code_i is short, it's usually OK to put it on the same
line with Code_i (but not with Code_i+1).
