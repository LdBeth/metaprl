The "Simple" and "Verbose" versions of the refiner

For each version of the term module (see term_modules.txt) two
versions of the refiner can be built - a "simple" and a "verbose" one.
The verbose version tries to keep track and raise verbose exceptions
while simple version usually raises a "generic" exception (take a look
at the REF_RAISE macro in refiner/refsig/refine_error.mlh).

The verbose version is great for debugging (and we place all debugging
in the verbose version only), but sometimes it is much slower.
To get the verbose version, set REFINER to be VERBOSE in mk/config
and to get the simple version, set REFINER to be SIMPLE.

Since the simple and verbose versions of the refiner files are
very similar, we use a preprocessor to generate them.
For the verbose version, the refiner files are preprocessed
with the VERBOSE_EXN macro defined and for the simple version -
with the SIMPLE_EXN macro defined.
