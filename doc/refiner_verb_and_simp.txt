"Simple" and "Verbose" Versions of the Refiner

Most files in refiner directory have a verbose (_verb) and a simple
(_simp) versions. The verbose version tries to keep track and raise
verbose exceptions while simple version usually raises a "generic"
exception (take a look at ref_raise macro an
refiner/refsig/refine_error.h). Verbose version is great for debugging
(and we place all debugging in the verbose version only), but sometimes it
is much slower. Since _verb and _simp files are usually very similar, we
usually generate them with the cpp C preprocessor from a single file
(.ml's are generated from .mlp and .mli's - from .mlip). _verb file is
generated with VERBOSE_EXN defined while _simp file is generated with
VERBOSE_EXN undefined.
