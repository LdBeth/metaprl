The "Simple" and "Verbose" versions of the refiner

Most files in the refiner directory have a verbose (_verb) and a
simple (_simp) versions.  The verbose version tries to keep track and
raise verbose exceptions while simple version usually raises a
"generic" exception (take a look at the REF_RAISE macro an
refiner/refsig/refine_error.mlh).  The verbose version is great for
debugging (and we place all debugging in the verbose version only),
but sometimes it is much slower.  Since _verb and _simp files are
usually very similar, we usually use a preprocessor.  If REFINER is
defined to be VERBOSE (in mk/config) you get the verbose version and
if it is defined to be SIMPLE, then you get the simple version.
