This directory used to contain OCaml patches necessary for compiling MetaPRL.

For OCaml 3.08.0, the only modification to OCaml that is needed for MetaPRL
is copying 8 extra files out of the build tree (as listed in
doc/htmlman/install.html and http://metaprl.org/install.html). An alternative
to copying the files manually is to apply the
"ocaml-3.08-wish1804.patch" before compiling OCaml (or before running
"make install" on a compiled OCaml tree).

For OCaml 3.08.1, in addition to the above you will also need to apply the
ocaml-3.08.1-bug3142.patch to roll back a recent camlp4 change that broke the
pa_macro package.
