This directory contains the patches necessary to be able to compile MetaPRL.

You need to apply patches in the following order:

1) camlp4-%{version}-opt.patch
     (only if you want to be able to compile MetaPRL to native code).
2) camlp4-%{verison}-plexer.patch
     (it is necessary to give MetaPRL access do "documentation" comments,
      MetaPRL will not compile w/o this patch).
3) camlp4-%{verison}-version.patch
     (or you may override the version in MetaPRL's mk/preface instead).
