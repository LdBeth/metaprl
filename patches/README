This directory used to contain OCaml patches necessary for compiling MetaPRL.

As of OCaml 3.08.0, the only modification to OCaml that is needed for MetaPRL
is copying 8 extra files out of the build tree (as listed in
doc/htmlman/install.html and http://metaprl.org/install.html). An alternative
to copying the files manually is to apply the
"ocaml-%{version}-wish1804.patch" before compiling OCaml (or before running
"make install" on a compiled OCaml tree).
