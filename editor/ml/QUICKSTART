QUICK START WITH PROOF EDITOR

Toploops to use:

for bytecode --
  editor/ml/mptop
  editor/ml/mp   (with   #use "x.ml";; as the first command, 
                  not recommended for beginners)
for native code --
  editor/ml/mpopt

Navigation:

ls: string -> unit
    lists the contents of the current  module (theory, proof)
  Variants:
  ls "";;   -- lists everything (in proof lists current proof node),
  ls "R";;  -- lists rules,
  ls "r";;  -- lists rewrites, 
  ls "u";;  -- lists everything unproved.

pwd ();;   returnes current path in the _loaded_module_ tree.  

cd: string -> unit
    provides navigation in the loaded module tree.
   Examples:
   cd "itt_int_base"
   cd "/";;
   cd "..";;
   cd "<rulename/rwname>";; --   cd to the proof of the rule/rewrite.

Navigation in proofs:
   root ();;
   down <subgoal number> ;;
   up <number of levels>;;

   next ();; - go to next unproved leaf in proof/modules (to be implemented).

Proof refinement:
   refine <tactic>;;  see itt_quickref.txt for ITT tactics.

Save proof:
When you cd into some theory for the first time, MetaPRL reads the
newest among the .prla, .prlb and .cmoz
  save ();;  -- current module in .prlb file  
                (but only if it was modified; for local use),  
  save_all ();; -- all modified modules,
  export ();; -- in .prla file (for cvs, ...)
------------------------
  export() function: 
  Note that it uses the old .prla file as a part of
  input (it tries to keep as many lines as possible unchanged to be more
  CVS-friendly), so if you exported the same theory several times between
  commits, it may be a good idea to
  1) Start MetaPRL and load the theory
  2) save() (just in case)
  3) Remove the .prla file and do a CVS update to get the old version of
  it.
  4) Do export()
  5) commit.
-------------------------
 
Proof expansion:
   expand ();;
     -- re-runs the proof (that's at and under the current node you are at);
   expand_all ();;	
     -- re-runs all proofs in the current node
     -- from root - re-runs all proofs in MetaPRL

Object status:
   status ();;
     -- tells the status of the current object
   status_all ();;
     -- re-runs all proofs in the current node and tells their status
     -- from root - same for all the proofs in MetaPRL

Proof checking:

   check ();;
   check_all ();;  -- not imlpemented yet.

WHERE AND HOW TO TRY:

  As long as you have TESTS=yes in mk/config, it's easier to just use
  itt_test for tests.
  1) Check the variable TESTS in mk/config.
  2) Check itt_test.ml to contain lines

     include itt_theory
     open Refiner.Refiner.TermType
     open Tactic_type.Tacticals
     open Tactic_type.Conversionals

  and itt_test.mli    --

     open Refiner.Refiner.TermType
     open Tactic_type.Tacticals
     open Tactic_type.Conversionals

  3) Write  your rules/rewrites there and try to prove them.
  Use emacs interface and editor/prl-hack.el for good printing.


HOW TO USE prl-hack.el

Once:
  1) You need the mp12 font to be instaled. It is in editor/fonts directory. 
  2) Make a symbolic link in your home directory to meta-prl/   :
       cd
       ln -s <path>/meta-prl/ ./   

Every time:
  3) Start emacs.
  4) Load prl_hack (in emacs, M-... usually means Alt-... ):
       M-x load-file                                  
       meta-prl/editor/emacs/prl-hack.el   
     
     Comments:
               3+4) alternative:
               emacs -l meta-prl/editor/emacs/prl-hack.el

               Another substitution for 4):
               Add the following line to your ~/.emacs
               (load-file "~/meta-prl/editor/emacs/prl-hack.el")

  5) Start the shell for MetaPrl in emacs (uses mp12 font) :
       M-x meta-prl    
  6) In this shell cd to meta-prl/editor/ml/ and 
     start any toploop  (mptop, mp,  mpopt)
       

For Connection to Nuprl5 using Jprover:

  * Below we assume that: 
    - Nuprl is running on host, hostname.
    - The Nuprl library environment is named libenv.
    - Nuprl is listening for connections on port, xxxx.  (in nuprl lib, command is mosa xxxx)
    - The Nuprl database is at "/home/nuprl/nuprl5/NuPrlDB/"

  1) Set the environment variables:  
     NUPRL_HOST = hostname, NUPRL_PORT = xxxx, and MP_PORT.  
     The first 2 are determined by your running nuprl session, and the third 
     is an arbitrary open port number that you will set.
  2) Start editor/ml/mp
  3) open Nuprl_run;;
  4) Execute  NuprlRun.run_jprover "libenv";;

  To use jprover from nuprl, simply call the tactic, Jprover, on your proof.

  * Alternatively, don't bother setting environment variables, or worry about the database setting.
 
  1) Start editor/ml/mp
  2) open Nuprl_run;;
  3) Execute  NuprlRun.run_connection_with_hook xxxx yyyy hostname libenv "/home/nuprl/fsys/baldwinx/tmp/algebra/nuprldb/" Nuprl_jprover.jprover_hook;;
*)
