To compile Nuprl-Light for the first time:
   1. You need to set the CAMLLIB directory.
      On mojave:
      % setenv CAMLLIB /usr/lib/ocaml-1.07

   2. Make the dependencies:
      % make depend

   3. Build it
      % make

TODO:

1. Sequent variable naming convention (for example, look at capture in cut rule).
