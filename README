To run MetaPRL for the first time:

   0. Make sure that you have ocaml (including camlp4) installed.
      If you are using RedHat Linux, you can download ocaml RPM from
      http://files.metaprl.org/RPM/
      Otherwise you need to build camlp4 from sources yourself,
      applying the patches from the patches directory.

   1. If you did not use our RPMs and installed ocaml and/or camlp4 yourself,
      you may need to set the environment variables for
      CAMLLIB and CAMLP4LIB directories, for example:
      % setenv CAMLLIB /usr/lib/ocaml
      % setenv CAMLP4LIB /usr/lib/ocaml/camlp4
      By defaut, /usr/lib/ocaml and /usr/lib/ocaml/camlp4 are used

   2. Create a make config file
      % make mk/config

   3. Edit mk/config

   4. Build MetaPRL
      % make opt  (native code version - compiles a little slower, but runs much faster)
      or
      % make    (bytecode version)

   5. Run MetaPRL
      % editor/ml/mpopt   (native code)
      or
      % editor/ml/mptop   (bytecode)
      or 
      % editor/ml/mpxterm (native code in a new xterm usung a correct font)
     

The file  editor/ml/QUICKSTART contains some hints on the usage
of MetaPRL proof editor.
