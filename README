In order to compile MetaPRL, you need:

   1. The OCaml compiler
   2. The OMake build system
   3. Optional, but highly recommended - openssl library with header files
      (provided by the openssl-devel package on some systems).

Note that MetaPRL is likely to require very specific versions of OCaml and OMake.
Refer to doc/htmlman/install.html or to http://metaprl.org/install.html
for detaled instructions and more information.

For additional information on Win32 and Mac OS X installation see README.WIN32
and README.MACOSX respectively.

If you plan to write some code, take a look the Developer Guide
before you start. Go to either doc/htmlman/developer-guide/default.html
or to http://metaprl.org/developer-guide/default.html
