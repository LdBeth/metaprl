To run MetaPRL for the first time:

   0. Make sure that you have ocaml and camlp4 installed. 
      If you are using RedHat Linux, you can download 
      ocaml and camlp4 RPMs from 
      ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/nuprl/MetaPRL/RPM/
      Otherwise you need to apply patches from 
      ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/nuprl/MetaPRL/patches/

   1. If you did not use our RPMs and installed ocaml and/or camlp4 yourself,
      may need to set the environment variables for
      CAMLLIB and CAMLP4LIB directories, for example:
      % setenv CAMLLIB /usr/lib/ocaml
      % setenv CAMLP4LIB /usr/lib/camlp4
      By defaut, /usr/lib/ocaml and /usr/lib/camlp4 are used

   2. Build it
      % make    (bytecode version)
      or
      % make opt  (native code version - compiles slower, but runs faster)

   3. Run it
      % cd editor/ml; ./mptop  (bytecode)
      or
      % cd editor/ml; ./mpopt  (native code)
