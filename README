To run MetaPRL for the first time:

   0. Make sure that you have OCaml (including Camlp4) installed.
      If you are using Red Hat Linux, you can download OCaml binary
      packages from http://files.metaprl.org/RPM/
      Otherwise you need to build OCaml from sources yourself,
      applying the patch(es) from the patches directory.

      Note: MetaPRL needs a specific version of OCaml. The mk/preface
      file lists the version(s) of OCaml that would work with
      the version of MetaPRL you have downloaded.

   1. Create the make configuration files
      % make mk/config mk/config.local

   2. If you did not use our RPMs and installed OCaml and/or Camlp4 yourself,
      you may need to set the variables for CAMLLIB and CAMLP4LIB directories.
      You can either set them in the mk/config.local file, for example:
      CAMLLIB=/usr/lib/ocaml
      CAMLP4LIB=/usr/lib/ocaml/Camlp4
      or in the environment. If a variable is set in both, mk/config.local
      takes precedence over the environment.
      By default, /usr/lib/ocaml and /usr/lib/ocaml/Camlp4 are used

   3. Edit mk/config (instructions are provided in the file itself).

   4. Build MetaPRL
      % make opt  (native code version - compiles a little slower,
                   but runs much faster)
      or
      % make    (bytecode version)

   5. Run MetaPRL
      % editor/ml/mpxterm (native code in a new xterm using a correct font)
      or 
      % editor/ml/mpopt   (native code)
      or
      % editor/ml/mptop   (bytecode)
     

The file  editor/ml/QUICKSTART contains some hints on the usage
of MetaPRL proof editor.
