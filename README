To compile Nuprl-Light for the first time:

   0. Make sure that you have ocaml and camlp4 installed. 
      If you are using RedHat Linux, you can download 
      ocaml and camlp4 RPMs from 
      ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/hurricane/

   1. You need to set the environment variables for
      CAMLLIB and CAMLP4LIB directories:
      % setenv CAMLLIB /usr/lib/ocaml
      % setenv CAMLP4LIB /usr/lib/camlp4

   2. Make the dependencies:
      % make depend

   3. Build it
      % make

TODO:

1. Sequent variable naming convention (for example, look at capture in cut rule).
