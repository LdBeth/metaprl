 * This is a "shared" marshaler, meaning that there can be several
 * marshaler that provide a model of shared memory over a communication
 * channel.

 *      -------------               -------------
 *      | Marshal 1 |     ...       | Marshal n |
 *      -------------               -------------
 *           |             |              |
 *           \             |              /
 *            ----------\  |  /-----------
 *                      |  |  |
 *                ---------------------
 *                | Broadcast channel |
 *                ---------------------
 *
 * The application interface (upper) interface has two functions:
 *    marshal: format a value to be sent on the channel.
 *       The value to broadcast and a copy is saved at every
 *       marshaler.
 *    unmarshal: handle a value sent on the communication
 *       channel.  The value is returned as the result of
 *       this function.
 *
 * The membership to the communication channel is allowed to change.
 * We require these invariants:
 *    1. All broadcast messages are received in the same order
 *    2. The channel membership is known to all marshalers
 *
 * The view management is handled in these phases:
 *    1. Initially, a marshaler is the only member of its communication channel
 *    2. Channels may split and merge.
 *       These are the phases of the membership change:
 *
 *       a. When the membership is going to change, all marshalers that
 *          are involved are notified with the "block" function.  If the
 *          client is threaded, all "marshal" calls are blocked.
 *       b. When the membership is determined, all marshalers are notified with
 *          the number of channel members.  Each one broadcasts a view_membership
 *          message of all marshalers it has known in the past.
 *       c. When a marshaler receives all the view_membership messages, it
 *          determines which values it is going to act as "owner" for,
 *          and it broadcasts a view_summary of all the values.
 *       d. When a marshaler receives a view_summary, it broadcasts
 *          a view_additional message with all the values the originator
 *          did not know about.
 *       d. When all marshalers have received all summaries and additional
 *          values, the global state is consistent, and the view change
 *          is complete.
 * The view change is not required to complete: another view change may start
 * before the current change is complete.  the new view change cancels the old
 * change.  In general, marshaling is blocked wheil the view change is coccurring.
 *
 * There is also distributed garbage collection.  A client can initiate
 * garbage collection at any time except during a view change.  Here are the
 * phases:
 *       a. The "gc" function runs the collector locally,
 *          and broadcasts a gc_notify message that summarizes
 *          the values that have been collected.
 *       b. When a remote marshaler receives the notification,
 *          it sends a gc_response with the objects that it does
 *          not want to be collected.
 *       c. When the originating marshaler gets responses from
 *          all remote marshalers, it cancels collection of values
 *          in the responses, and it broadcasts a gc_update with
 *          a list of values that _really_ should be collected.
 * The garbage collector may be interrupted at any time by a view change.
 * Also, marshaling is not halted by the garbage collector, except during
 * the function calls themselves.
